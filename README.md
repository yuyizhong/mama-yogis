## Features left to implement

- As the submiitted data from form is currently not stored to the server, therefore a further implementation is to build a database.
- Form can be simplified by using JavaScript to filter the different time for different class without adding notes next to each time options.
- Reflexiable images will avoid having images pixelated or unnecessarily stretched. I will look into it When the time and resource become available.

 - Issue fund during the page development:
   - I originally used 3 identical forms for 3 studio yogo classes booking. All the lables are the same besides the options of the time are different for each class. 
 - Fix:
   - I simplify the forms into 1. As without using JavaScript, I wont be able to provide the relevant time options based on the yoga class selected. I then only add one more radio choice for users to select the yoga class and then put all the time slots in the select drop down list, with class name next to each time slot.
